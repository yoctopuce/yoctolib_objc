 * PHP, and Java don't provide direct access to USB hardware, so usb will
 * not work with these. In this case, use a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub (see below).
 *
 * <b><i>x.x.x.x</i></b> or <b><i>hostname</i></b>: The API will use the devices connected to the
 * host with the given IP address or hostname. That host can be a regular computer
 * running a VirtualHub, or a networked YoctoHub such as YoctoHub-Ethernet or
 * YoctoHub-Wireless. If you want to use the VirtualHub running on you local
 * computer, use the IP address 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * <b>callback</b>: that keyword make the API run in "<i>HTTP Callback</i>" mode.
 * This a special mode allowing to take control of Yoctopuce devices
 * through a NAT filter when using a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub. You only
 * need to configure your hub to call your server script on a regular basis.
 * This mode is currently available for PHP and Node.JS only.

 * that you must stop the VirtualHub software before starting
 * an application that uses direct USB access. The workaround
 * for this limitation is to setup the library to use the VirtualHub
 * rather than direct USB access.

 * PHP, and Java don't provide direct access to USB hardware, so usb will
 * not work with these. In this case, use a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub (see below).

 * <b><i>x.x.x.x</i></b> or <b><i>hostname</i></b>: The API will use the devices connected to the
 * host with the given IP address or hostname. That host can be a regular computer
 * running a VirtualHub, or a networked YoctoHub such as YoctoHub-Ethernet or
 * YoctoHub-Wireless. If you want to use the VirtualHub running on you local
 * computer, use the IP address 127.0.0.1.
 *
 * <b>callback</b>: that keyword make the API run in "<i>HTTP Callback</i>" mode.
 * This a special mode allowing to take control of Yoctopuce devices
 * through a NAT filter when using a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub. You only
 * need to configure your hub to call your server script on a regular basis.
 * This mode is currently available for PHP and Node.JS only.

 * that you must stop the VirtualHub software before starting
 * an application that uses direct USB access. The workaround
